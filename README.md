# SCORN Old-School Roleplaying Engine

This is a fork of Yochai Gal's [Cairn](https://github.com/yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT).
It brings in my personal homebrew into the module.

## Changes from Cairn

- Removed token art (license is incompatible with AGPL)
- Max slots is now STR or 10, whichever is higher

## Installation

1. In the FVTT Game Systems Menu, click `Install System`
2. Enter the Manifest URL: `https://github.com/sean-clayton/scorn-fvtt/releases/latest/download/system.json`
3. Allow players to "Create new Actors" in the "Configure Settings" permissions menu
